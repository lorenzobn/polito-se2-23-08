### Detailed statistics

We are reporting data for all stories as if we completed them

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |   14|   N/A  | 30 | 32.25  |
|_#1_   |   4 | 5| 15  |  16 |
| _#2_|  4 | 8 |20 | 19.33 |
| _#3_ | 4 | 5 |24 | 22.25 |
| _#4_ | 4| 13 |20 | 17 |



##### Points/issues that specifically emerge from comparison between hour estimation and actual:
- We slightly overestimated our tasks to ensure that we have enough time left for continous testing and feedback. 

##### Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual):
##### Estimate:
  - hours per task average: 3.63
  - standard deviation: 4.749
##### Actual:  
  - hours per task average:  3.56
  - standard deviation: 3.641


##### Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1  

  - (109/106.83 - 1) = 0.02
