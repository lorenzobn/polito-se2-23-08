### Detailed statistics

We are reporting data for all stories as if we completed them

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |

##### Points/issues that specifically emerge from comparison between hour estimation and actual:
-

##### Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual):
##### Estimate:
  - hours per task average:  
  - standard deviation: 
##### Actual:  
  - hours per task average:  
  - standard deviation: 

##### Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1

  - Total hours spent : 2
  

## ASSESSMENT

**-What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?**
- 
  
**-What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?**

**Negative lesson** (the biggest one):  
- We started to implement essential requirements e.g. the virtual clock towards the end of the sprint, which was a risk.

**Positive lesson**:  
- We did a rigorous end to end to test check if every component is working. And all the bugs, invalid requirements, and enhancement found in the E2E testing was effectively communicate to the team and re-implemented.

**-Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?**
- We set and respected the internal deadlines as a team.
- We merged and resolved the merge conflicts in the branches regularly.
- We did a thorough E2E testing to check everything is working locally and with docker. 

**-Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?**
- We delivered every story according to the definition of done (including dockerization of the environment). 

**-Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
- We should consider all the intersecting components such as a virtual-clock at the start of the sprint to ensure that it's being implemented.

**-One thing you are proud of as a Team!!**
- The team continously resolved the github issues that were opened during the E2E testing, and the team strategically prioritized bugs, invalid tagged issues over the enhancement, however, we were still able to complete even the enhancement suggestion.
